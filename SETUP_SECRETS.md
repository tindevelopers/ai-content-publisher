## 🔑 Required Secrets Setup

To enable full automation, you need to set up these GitHub secrets:

### 1. NPM Publishing
Go to: https://github.com/tindevelopers/ai-content-publisher/settings/secrets/actions

**NPM_TOKEN**
1. Go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) and log in
2. Go to Access Tokens: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens
3. Click "Generate New Token" → "Automation"
4. Copy the token and add as GitHub secret `NPM_TOKEN`

### 2. Vercel Deployment
**VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Go to Settings → Tokens
3. Create new token, copy it as `VERCEL_TOKEN`

4. Import the GitHub repository to Vercel:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import `tindevelopers/ai-content-publisher`
   - Configure build settings:
     ```
     Framework Preset: Other
     Build Command: npm run build && mkdir -p docs-site && cp README.md docs-site/index.md && cp GETTING_STARTED.md docs-site/getting-started.md
     Output Directory: docs-site
     Install Command: npm ci
     ```

5. Get Project and Org IDs:
   - In Vercel project settings, copy:
     - `VERCEL_ORG_ID` (from General settings)
     - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` (from General settings)

### 3. Optional: Test Coverage
**CODECOV_TOKEN**
1. Go to [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Add the repository
4. Copy the upload token as `CODECOV_TOKEN`

## 📋 GitHub Secrets Summary

Add these secrets at: https://github.com/tindevelopers/ai-content-publisher/settings/secrets/actions

| Secret Name | Description | Required |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `NPM_TOKEN` | NPM automation token | ✅ Yes |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Vercel deployment token | ✅ Yes |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | Vercel organization ID | ✅ Yes |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | Vercel project ID | ✅ Yes |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | Test coverage reporting | ⚠️ Optional |

## 🎯 What Happens After Setup

### ✅ When you push to main:
- CI tests run on Node.js 16, 18, 20
- Linting and security audits
- Documentation deploys to Vercel
- Test coverage reports (if Codecov configured)

### 🏷️ When you create version tags:
- Semantic release creates GitHub releases
- NPM package published automatically
- Docker image built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry
- Changelog updated automatically

### 📚 Documentation:
- Auto-deploys to Vercel at your custom domain
- API documentation generated from TypeScript
- Examples and guides always current

## 🔧 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Set up NPM publishing:**
   ```bash
   # Add NPM_TOKEN secret to GitHub
   # Then tag a release to trigger publishing
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

2. **Set up Vercel deployment:**
   - Import repository to Vercel
   - Add Vercel secrets to GitHub
   - Documentation will auto-deploy

3. **Test the automation:**
   - Make a small change
   - Push to main
   - Watch workflows run

## 📊 Monitoring

### GitHub Actions:
- View workflows: https://github.com/tindevelopers/ai-content-publisher/actions
