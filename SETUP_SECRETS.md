## 🔑 Required Secrets Setup

To enable full automation, you need to set up these GitHub secrets:

### 1. Vercel Deployment
**VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Go to Settings → Tokens
3. Create new token, copy it as `VERCEL_TOKEN`

4. Import the GitHub repository to Vercel:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import `tindevelopers/ai-content-publisher`
   - Configure build settings:
     ```
     Framework Preset: Other
     Build Command: npm run build && mkdir -p docs-site && cp README.md docs-site/index.md && cp GETTING_STARTED.md docs-site/getting-started.md
     Output Directory: docs-site
     Install Command: npm ci
     ```

5. Get Project and Org IDs:
   - In Vercel project settings, copy:
     - `VERCEL_ORG_ID` (from General settings)
     - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` (from General settings)

### 2. Optional: Test Coverage
**CODECOV_TOKEN**
1. Go to [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Add the repository
4. Copy the upload token as `CODECOV_TOKEN`

| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | Test coverage reporting | ⚠️ Optional |

## 🎯 What Happens After Setup

### ✅ When you push to main:
- CI tests run on Node.js 16, 18, 20
- Linting and security audits
- Documentation deploys to Vercel
- Test coverage reports (if Codecov configured)

### 🏷️ When you create version tags:
- GitHub releases created with changelog
- Source code packaged and attached to release
- Documentation updated automatically

### 📚 Documentation:
- Auto-deploys to Vercel at your custom domain
- API documentation generated from TypeScript
- Examples and guides always current

## 🔧 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Set up Vercel deployment:**
   - Import repository to Vercel
   - Add Vercel secrets to GitHub
   - Documentation will auto-deploy

2. **Test the automation:**
   - Make a small change
   - Push to main
   - Watch workflows run

## 📊 Monitoring

### GitHub Actions:
- View workflows: https://github.com/tindevelopers/ai-content-publisher/actions

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Failures:
1. Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
2. Verify all required secrets are set
3. Ensure secret values are correct (no extra spaces)

### GitHub Release Issues:
- Verify repository permissions
- Check if tag format is correct (v1.0.0)
- Ensure release workflow has necessary permissions

### Vercel Deployment Issues:
- Verify build command is correct
- Check Vercel project settings
- Ensure tokens have correct permissions

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:
- ✅ GitHub Actions show green checkmarks
- ✅ Vercel documentation site loads
- ✅ GitHub releases are created automatically
- ✅ Source code is accessible and buildable

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Verify all secrets are correctly set
3. Test individual components (build, test, lint)
4. Review the DEPLOYMENT.md guide for detailed troubleshooting
